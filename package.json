  "description": "I have used Twit to get through the authentication. For the access key and consumer keys I used my personal tokens and hence have not included those in here(.env) as it exposes my credentials. However, to make it easier for you I have attched the .env file to replace if the hosted url doesn't work. I just created developer twitter account only for this project and as a matter of safety, i will delete the account once code is reviewed and processes are done.",
